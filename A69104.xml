            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>ORASMOCHE AS IN</hi> this boke, whiche is ſette furthe for the inſtitution and crudition of the common people, the articles of our faith haue the fyrſte place, it is very neceſſarye, before we entre into the declaration of the ſayde articles, ſome thyng to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of fayth, to the intent that it may be knowen. what is ment proprely by the worde <hi>Faythe,</hi> as it is apperteynyng to a chriſten man, who by faythe is partaker of goddis benefites by Chryſte. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Faith be diuerſly taken in ſcripture, it ſhal be ſufficient to entreate here, of two kyndes or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the ſame.</p>
               <p>FAythe in the fyrſte acception, is conſydered as it is a ſeuerall gyfte of god by it ſelfe dyſtincte from hope and charitie, and ſo taken, it ſignifieth a perſwaſion and belefe, wrought by god in mannes harte, wherby he aſſenteth, granteth, and taketh for true, not onely that god is, whiche knoweledge is taught and declared by the marueylous workes of the creation of the worlde,<note place="margin">Rom. i.</note> as ſayeth ſaint Paule in the epiſtle to the Romains, but alſo that al the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and ſayenges of god, which be reueled and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſcripture, be of moſte certaine truthe and infallible veritie. And further alſo, that all thoſe thynges, whiche were taught by the apoſtles, and haue ben by an hole vniuerſal conſent of the church
<pb facs="tcp:11197:6"/>
of Chriſte, euer ſythe that tyme, taught continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and taken alwayes for true, ought to be receyued accepted and kept, as a perfect doctrine apoſtolyke. And this is the firſt acception of Faith, which man hath of god, wherin man leaneth not to his owne naturall knowledge, whiche is by reaſon, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the knowledge, atteyned by Fayth, without the whiche Faith, we be ignorant and blynde, and can not vnderſtande, accordynge as the prophete Eſaie ſaythe,<note place="margin">Vii. iuxta ſept,</note> 
                  <hi>Niſi credideritis, non intelligitis, Onles ye beleue, ye ſhall not vnderſtande.</hi> And this faithe is the beginning, entrie, and introduction vnto all chriſten relygion and godlynes. For as ſaynt Paul ſayth,<note place="margin">Hebr. xi.</note> He that commeth to god, muſt beleue that be is, and that he is a rewarder vnto theym, whiche ſeeke to pleaſe hym. And this faithe, although it be the neceſſary beginning of all rightuouſneſſe, yet if it procede not further, to Hope and Charitie, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſcripture a deade Faythe, bycauſe it is voyde and deſtitute of the lyfe and efficacy of charitie.</p>
               <p>Faythe in the ſecond acception is conſidered as it hath hope and charitie annexed and ioyned vnto it: And faith ſo taken ſignifieth not onely the belefe and perſwaſion before mentioned in the fyrſt acception, but alſo a ſure confidence and hope, to atteyn what ſo euer god hath promiſed for Chriſtes ſake, and an harty loue to god, and obedience to his commaundementes. And this Faythe is a lyuely faythe, and worketh in man a redy ſubmiſſion of his wyll to goddis wylle. And this is the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faythe that worketh by charitie, whiche faynte
<pb facs="tcp:11197:6"/>
Paule vnto the Galathians affirmeth to be of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and ſtrengthe in <hi>CHRISTE IESV.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gala. v.</note> By this Faythe, Abraham, not knowing whether he ſhulde goo, went out of his countreye,<note place="margin">Hebr. xi.</note> and dwelte in the lande of beheſte, as in a ſtraunge lande, lokynge and truſtynge for a citie founded and buylded by almyghty god. By this Faythe alſo, he was ready to offer vp his onely begotten ſonne Iſaac, whan he was tempted, in whom he loked for the promyſe, nothynge doubtynge, but that god was able to rayſe hym vp agayne frome deathe. And this wyſe is Faythe taken in the moſte part of the examples, whyche be recyted of ſainte Paule in the eleuenthe chapiter of his epiſtle to the Hebrues. And this Faythe euery chriſten man profeſſeth and couenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to keepe, whan he receyueth the ſacrament of baptiſme.</p>
               <p>For declaration whereof, it is to be noted, that all promyſes of god, made to man after the falle of Adam, for Chriſtes ſake, be made vnder this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that man ſhoulde beleue in god, and with the grace of god, gyuen for <hi>CHRISTE,</hi> endeuoure hym ſelfe to accomplyſhe goddis commandemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. The churche (therfore intendynge that man ſhoulde alwayes haue in mynde, how the promyſes of god be made vppon condition, and without ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinge of the condition, no man is partaker of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis promyſes) hathe taughte and ordeyned, that menne before they receyue baptiſme, ſhall promyſe and couenaunte to fulfylle the ſayde condytion, and to forſake the deuyll and the worlde, and to
<pb facs="tcp:11197:7"/>
ſerue onely god. And of this eſpeciall couenaunt, wherby man byndeth him ſelf to god, he is called in latyn <hi>Fidelis,</hi> faithefull, and he that neuer made the ſame couenant, or after he hath made it, renounceth and refuſeth the ſame, is called amonges chryſten men <hi>Infidelis,</hi> vnfaythfull or heathen. And bycauſe god hath made promiſe and couenant with man (as is before declared) whiche we muſte moſte aſſuredly beleue, that god wyll obſerue and kepe, and is euer in his wordes and promyſes, moſt true, moſte iuſte, moſte conſtant: therfore god is called (as he is in dede faythfull to man, and keepeth and obſerueth his fayth, that is to ſay, his promyſe to man, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng that man ſhulde lykewyſe kepe his faithe and promyſe towardes hym.</p>
               <p>Nowe of that whiche is beforeſayd, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that Fayth (as it is taken in the ſecond accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is the perfect faythe of a true chriſten man, and conteineth the obedience to the hole doctrine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſte. And thus is faythe taken of ſaynt Paule, and in other places of ſcripture, where it is ſayd, that we be iuſtified by fayth. In which places men may not thynke that we be iuſtified by faythe, as it is a ſeuerall vertue ſeparated from hope and charitie, feare of god and repentaunce, but by it is ment Faith, neither only ne alone, but with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd vertues coupled togyther, conteining as it is aforeſayde, the obedience to the hole doctrine and religion of Chriſte.</p>
               <p>And here is to be noted, that euery man, that dothe offende god, dothe not loſe his faythe therby.
<pb facs="tcp:11197:7"/>
For they that ſynne by frailtie and ſodeyn motions (whiche iuſte men doo not auoyde) and be taughte therfore of Chriſt to ſay in their <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes, as we forgyue them that treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſte vs: Yet thoſe men, ſo breaking their promyſe with god, and ſlackyng in ſuche care and deſyre, as they ſhulde haue to pleaſe god, neuertheleſſe be not accompted to haue loſt theyr fayth therby, yea they alſo who after the knowlege of god, fall into dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſynne aduiſedly, as they that committe murther, adultery, and other abhominations, and ſoo falle from faythe, as it is taken in the ſeconde acception, and be therfore out of the ſtate of grace and fauour of god for the tyme, yet do not thoſe men fall frome fayth, as it is taken in the fyrſt acception,<note place="margin">Luc. xii.</note> that is to ſaye from certayne and aſſured knowledge of god and his doctrine. And therfore the goſpell ſpeaketh of a ſeruaunt, that knoweth the wyl of his lord, and dothe it not. And ſaynt Iames in his epiſtle ſayeth,<note place="margin">Iacob. ii.</note> that Faythe may remayne without charitie. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a tranſgreſſour of the lawe of almyghty God after baptiſme, kepeth ſtyll a remorſe of conſcience, and the lyghte of knowledge by Faythe, wherby he ſeeth the remedyes, howe to atteyne remyſſion of ſynne, and by a ſpecial gyfte of further grace is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to vſe the ſame remedyes, and ſo by faythe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the wayes ordeined to atteine remiſſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as in the ſacrament of penance, ſhalbe declared.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue ſhewed two acceptions of fayth and declared, that the fayth of knowledge may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in hym that hath fallen from fayth, after the
<pb facs="tcp:11197:8"/>
ſecond acception. But whether there be any ſpecial particular knowlege, which man by faith hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of him ſelf, wherby he may teſtify to him ſelfe, that he is of the predeſtinates, which ſhal to thende perſeuere in their callynge, we haue not ſpoken, ne can not in ſcripture ne doctours find, that any ſuch faith can be taught or preached. Truth it is, that in the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes inſtituted by Chriſt, we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly beleue the workes of god in them, to our preſent comfort, and applycation of his grace and fauour, with aſſurance alſo, that he wyll not faile vs, if we fall not from hym. Wherfore ſo continuinge in the ſtate of grace with hym, we may beleue vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſaued. But foraſmoche as our owne frailty and naughtynes, ought euer to be feared in vs, it is therfore expedient for vs to lyue in contynuall watche, and continuall fight with our enemies, the deuyl, the fleſhe, and the world, and not to preſume to moche of our perſeuerance &amp; contynuance in the ſtate of grace, which on our behalfe is vncertayne and vnſtable. For although goddis promiſes made in Chriſte be immutable, yet he maketh them not to vs, but with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, ſo that his promiſe ſtandyng we may yet faile of the promiſe, bicauſe we kepe not our promiſe. And therfore if we aſſuredly recken v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſtate of our felicitie, as grounded vppon goddis promiſe, and do not therwith reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre, that no man ſhalbe crowned, onles he laufully fight, we ſhal triumph before the victory, and ſo loke in vain for that whiche is not otherwiſe promiſed, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a condition. And this euery chriſten man muſt aſſuredly beleue.</p>

                  <p>Secondly it is to be noted, that all true chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten men, ought and muſte moſte conſtantly beleue, maynteyne and defende all thoſe thinges to be true, whiche be comprehended in this Crede, and in the other .ii. credes, wherof the one is vſed to be ſayde at maſſe, and is approued by the auncyen: generall councelles, &amp; the other was made by the holye man Athanaſius: And alſo all other thynges which be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended in the hole body &amp; canon of the bible.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:11197:10"/>Moreouer we muſt knowe, that god the father is the fyrſt perſone in trinitie,<note place="margin">Father.</note> and Father of his onely begotten ſonne, the ſecond perſone in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and that he dyd begette him of his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by eternall generation, that is to ſay, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that neuer had begynning.</p>
                  <p>And where this article conteineth, that god the father is Almighty, it is as moch to ſay, as that he may do all thynges that he wil. in heauen and in earthe, and nothyng is to hym impoſſible, and that his godly power and myghte excelleth infinitely, and incomparably all other powers, in heauen, earth, and hell: ſo that all other powers whiche be in heauen, earthe, or hell, be nothynge as of theym ſelues, but haue all their might force and ſtrength of hym, and be all ſubiecte vnto his power, and can not reſyſt or lette the ſame. And althoughe god be omnipotent, and of infinite power, yet he is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or worker of any ſynne: for whan ſoeuer any ſynne is done by any creature, the ſame is wrought by the malice of the deuyll, or free wyll of man, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſufferance and permiſſion of god, not and by the working &amp; power of god, in ſtyryng vp, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theryng, or aſſiſting the malice of the euyll thought or deede.</p>

gouerne, ſuſteyne, and mainteine the hole worlde, and all creatures therin, by his onely good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and high prouidence, in ſo moche that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his continuall workynge, nothinge ſhulde be able, any while to continue.</p>
                  <p>And for the more euydent and playne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng of the firſte parte of this article, whyche is, I beleue in god, it is to be noted, that we muſte not onely beleue ſtedfaſtly, that god is, and that he is true in all his wordes and promyſes, and that he is omnipotente, and creatour of heauen and earthe, and ſo forthe: but we muſte alſo with this our beleue, loue god, and cleaue onely vnto hym, and that with al our harte and power, and ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and dwelle ſtyll in hym, by loue. It ſygnifieth alſo, that we muſt obey vnto his wyll, as well in al our inwarde thoughtes and affections, as alſo in al our outwarde actes and dedes, and that we muſt abhorre all vyce, and not wiſhe or deſyre of god, any euyll or vngodly thing. It ſygnyfyeth alſo that we muſt conſtantly betake and commytte our ſelues, and all ours holy vnto god, and fyxe all our hole hope, truſt, and confidence in hym, and quyete our ſelues in hym, beleuynge perfectly and aſſuredly that he wyll in dede ſhewe no leſſe goodneſſe, loue, mercy, grace, and fauour vnto vs, than he promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth by his word to do with vs, vſing our ſelues as afore is ſayde.</p>

                  <p>Wherby it appereth, that the vnitie of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly churches in ſundry places aſſembled, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not by knowledging of one gouernour in earth ouer al churches.

<pb facs="tcp:11197:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <p>The vnitie therfore of the churche, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by the biſhoppe of Romes auctoritie or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but the vnitie of the catholyke churche, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che all chriſten men in this article do profeſſe, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued and kepte, by the helpe and aſſiſtence of the holy ſpirite of god, in reteining and mainteynynge of ſuche doctrine and profeſſion of chriſten faithe, &amp; true obſeruance of the ſame, as is taughte by the ſcripture and the doctrine apoſtolike. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches ought not in the ſaid doctrine ſo accep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted and allowed to vary one from an other, for any lucre, arrogance, or any other worldly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but inuiolably to obſerue the ſame, ſo that by reaſon of that doctrine, eche churche that teacheth the ſame, maye be worthely called (as it is in dede) an apoſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like churche, that is to ſay, folowing ſuch teachyng as the apoſtels preached, with miniſtration of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che ſacramentes, as be approued by the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And this vnitie of the holy church of Chriſte, is not diuided by diſtance of place, nor by diuerſitie of traditions and ceremonies, dyuerſely obſerued in diuerſe churches, for good ordre of the ſame. For the churche of Corinthe, and of Epheſe, were one churche in god, thoughe the one were farre diſtant in place from the other: And though alſo in traditi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:24"/>
opinions, and policies, there was ſome diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie amonge them, lykewiſe as the churche of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande, Spaine, Italy, and Poole, be not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the vnitie, but be one churche in god, not withſtandynge, that amonge them, there is great diſtance of place, diuerſitie of traditions, not in all thinges vnitie of opinions, alteration in rites, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and ordinances, or eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame, as one churche peraduenture doth eſteme their ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, traditions, lawes, ordinances, and ceremonies to be of more vertue and efficacie, than an other churche dothe eſteme the ſame. As the churche of Rome doth affirme certaine of theyr lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces, to be of ſuche eſtimation, that they be of equall force with the worde of god, and that who ſo euer diſobeyeth or tranſgreſſeth the ſame, commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth deadly ſynne: Yet we perceyuing the ſame, to be diſcrepant from the truthe of ſcripture, muſt nedes therin diſſent from them. But ſuch diuerſitie in opi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nions, and other outward maners and cuſtomes of policie, doth not diſſolue and breake the vnitie, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is in one god, one faith, one doctrine of Chriſte and his ſacramentes, preſerued and kept in theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral churches, without any ſuperioritie or preemi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nence, that one churche by goddis lawes, maye or ought to chalenge ouer an other.</p>
                  <p>And therfore the churche of Rome, beinge but a ſeuerall churche, chalenginge that name of <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> aboue all other, dothe great wrong to all other churches, and dothe onely by force &amp; mayntenance, ſupport an vniuſt vſurpation: for that church hath
<pb facs="tcp:11197:24"/>
no more ryghte to that name, than the churche of Fraunce, Spayne, England, or Portugale, whiche be iuſtly called catholyke churches, in that they doo profeſſe, conſent, &amp; agree in one vnitie of true fayth, with other catholike churches. This vſurpation before reherſed well conſidered, it may appere, that the biſhop of Rome, doth contrary to goddis lawe, in chalengynge ſuperioritie and preeminence, by a cloke of goddis lawe ouer all. And yet to make an apparance, that it ſhulde be ſoo, he hathe and dothe wreſte ſcriptures for that purpoſe, contrary both to the true meanyng of the ſame, and the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ancient doctours of the church, ſo that by that chanleng he wold not do wrong onely to this chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of Englande, but alſo to all other churches, in claymyng this ſuperioritie, without any authoritie by god, ſo to him gyuen. For God by his goodnes hath called indifferently and equally, all ſuch chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in ſundry places, as his highe wiſedome, hath thought good to aſſemble and call vnto hym.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ephe. v.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; hath giuen hym ſelfe to the death for his churches ſake, to ſanctify her &amp; make her holy in cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſing her by the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain of water in his word &amp;c.</hi> So that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, nor can be of this church, but he which is cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrament of baptiſme: Lyke as the texe before alledged, ſheweth, where Chriſte ſaith:<note place="margin">Ioan. iii.</note>

                     <pb facs="tcp:11197:30"/>In this parte alſo it is to be noted, that children or men ones baptiſed, ought neuer to be baptiſed a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayne.

                  <p>Moreouer for bycauſe, as well this ſacrament of baptiſme, as all other ſacramentes inſtituted by Chriſte, haue all theyr vertue, efficacy, and ſtrength by the worde of god, which by his holy ſpirite, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth al the graces &amp; vertues, which be giuen by the ſacramentes, to all thoſe that worthily receyue the ſame: We muſt vnderſtand &amp; knowe, that although he which doth miniſter the ſacrament, be of a ſinful &amp; euill conuerſation, yet the vertue and effect of the ſacrament, is therby nothing diminiſhed or hurted, neither in infantes, nor yet in them, whiche beinge indued with the vſe of reaſon, come thervnto, truly contrite and penitent of al their ſinnes done before beleuyng &amp; confeſſing all the articles of the Crede, and hauyng a ſure fayth and truſte in the promiſes of god, of remiſſion of their ſynnes, and purpoſing euer after to lyue a chriſten lyfe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the cleere vnderſtanding of this ſacramente, it is to be conſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, what penance is, &amp; alſo what is the ſacrament of penance.</p>
                  <p>Penance is an inward ſorowe and griefe of the harte, for the ſynnes by vs doone and committed, and an hatrede and deteſtation of the ſame with an earneſt deſyre, to be purged frome them, and to recouer agayne the grace and fauour of god, by ſuche meanes and remedies, as god hath appoynted for the obteynyng therof, with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe and mynde, neuer to offende agayn. For he that ſayeth, that he is ſory for his offences commyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted agaynſt the hyghe maieſtie of god, and yet ſtyll contynueth or intendeth to contynue in the ſame, is no penytent perſon, but a diſſembler, or rather a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryder of penance. And thus is penaunce commonly taken in the ſcripture, as welle in the newe, as in the olde teſtament. And this penance is a thynge ſo neceſſary for mans ſaluation, that without it, no man that offendeth god, can be ſaued, or attayne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtyng lyfe.</p>
                  <p>The ſacrament of penaunce is proprely the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, pronounced by the prieſt, vpon ſuche as be penitent for their ſynnes, and ſo do knowledge and ſhewe them ſelues to be. To the obteynynge of the whiche abſolution or ſacrament of penaunce, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred, contrition, confeſſion, and ſatisfaction, as
<pb facs="tcp:11197:32"/>
wayes and meanes expedyent and neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the ſayde abſolution. In all which ways and meanes, fayth is neceſſarily required, as the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and foundation of all thynges, that are to be done for to atteyne the benefite of the ſacramente of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. For who can haue tru penance, with hope to atteyn any grace of remiſſion of ſinne therby, onles he beleue ſtedfaſtly, that god is, and that in the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the mean of our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſt, &amp; by the force of his paſſion, there is promiſe made to his church, to grant remiſſion of ſynnes, by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to ſuche as falling from the grace receyued in baptiſme, do at his callyng turn vnto him by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? And like as they, which were not baptiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infantes, whan they come to the yeres of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and deſyre baptiſme, be taught fyrſte to beleue in god, and to renounce the deuil &amp; his workes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon which ground of faith, they deſyre baptiſme, as a neceſſary ſacrament for remiſſion of ſyn: So eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, before he entreth into the wayes of fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full penance, muſt haue for a grounde and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch a belefe, as wherby he hopeth and loketh by the ſacrament of penance, to atteine remiſſion of all his ſynnes, whervnto we do come (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd) by contrition, confeſſion, and ſatiſfaction.</p>
                  <p>Contrition is an inwarde ſorow and griefe for ſynne, whiche euery true penitent, called by goddis grace, hath by knowlege of the worde of god, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, remembrynge his owne ſynfull and viciouſe lyuynge, wherby he hath prouoked the hygh indy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation and wrathe of god: and on the other ſyde,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:32"/>
conſideryng, the dignitie and puritie of that ſtate, whervnto he was called in baptiſme, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſe made there to god, the manifold benefites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, dayly receyued of god. Herevpon the ſayd peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, moued and ſtirred, with the great loue &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of god, ſhewed before towardes him on the one partie, and his owne ingratitude or vnkindnes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes god on thother partie, conceiueth an erneſt ſorowe, for that he hath relinquiſſhed ſo louynge a lorde, and an hatefull diſpleaſure, that he hath fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſinne, and therby ſo greuouſly offended god, of whom he was before called, to be in the ſtate of a ſonne, &amp; inheritour with our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>And thus beynge moued and troubled in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and lamentynge the myſerable ſtate, whiche he is nowe in, by his owne defaut, is pricked and ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his harte, accordynge to the teachynge of his mother, holy churche; to repaire to ſuche a miniſter as god hath ordeyned, to pronounce the ſentence of remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynne. And knowing him to occupy that place, as deputed of god, doth proſtrate him ſelfe to god, &amp; there humbly procedeth to confeſſion, wherin he callyng to his remembrance, his ſinful life paſt, doth knowlege to the prieſt al ſuch ſynnes in which his conſcience telleth hym, that he hath greuouſely offended the goodnes of god almighty, &amp; the ſame, before the prieſt goddis miniſter, he declareth &amp; vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with his mouthe, and ſo blameth, accuſeth,<note place="margin">Luc. xv.

<pb facs="tcp:11197:33"/>
of his lord Ieſu Chriſte, and dyd it not, was indued with many giftes of the holy goſte, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed them not. And ſo deteſtinge and abhorryng ſynne, and deſyrous to be rayſed frome that eſtate, confeſſeth in humilitie, the cauſe of ſynne, to haue ben of hym ſelfe, by yeldyng to the concupiſcence of the fleſhe, the worlde, and the deuyll. Wherfore he is gladde to ſubmytte hym ſelfe to ſuche dyſcipline and wayes of reformation, as the prieſt hering his ſynnes &amp; offences, ſhall by his diſcretion and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, accordyng to the word of god, thynke conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Whiche humble ſubmiſſion to the goſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with conſent and agrement to receyue the ſaid diſcipline, is a parte of ſatisfaction, whiche is the thirde way or meane to the ſacrament of penaunce, as is before reherſed.</p>
                  <p>And this ſatisfaction declareth a deſire to pleſe and content god his father, for the vnkyndenes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes hym, in fallynge from the eſtate of grace, wherein he was called to be his ſonne, and inhery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of heauen, vnto the myſerable condition of ſynne, wherby he hath made hym ſelfe mooſte vile bondman vnto the deuyll.</p>
                  <p>But here ye muſt vnderſtand, that the ſatiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (whiche is here ſpoken of) is not ſo to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as though the penitent ſynner coulde worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merite or deſerue remiſſion of ſinnes, by any peyn or puniſhement to be by him ſuffered, or to make to god any iuſte or full recompence, equiualent to the ſynne, that he hath committed againſt him, and ſo to ſatiſfie, which he can neuer do. For that ſatiſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:33"/>
hath onely our ſauiour Chriſte wrought in his glorious paſſion. But to ſatiſfie (as here is me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by ſatiſfaction) is to pleſe god with an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly harte, redy to bringe forth the fruites of penance, &amp; to bringe them forth in dede, as in almes, prayer, and faſtynge, with all ſuche meanes, as maye ſerue for the cutting away of the occaſion of ſynne, as the miniſter ſhall thynke good, according to the worde of god, and with ſuche weping, lamentyng, &amp; way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as do burſt out of the hart, with a ful purpoſe to leade a newe life, and therwith to forgiue al men theyr treſpaces, to reſtore to all men, that he hath vniuſtly taken or reteyned from them, to recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce all hurtes and iniuries done by hym, accordyng to his abilitie and power, and as he may, not onely to wyll, but alſo to do thus, to his neighbour in dede, wherin the neighbour ought to be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>And hereby appereth, howe god eſtemeth ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, both to him ſelfe, and to the neyghbour, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wyll and power, and not after the equiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of that which is done. For to god no man can ſo ſatisfie for ſinne. And Chriſt therfore hath ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for all, by vertue wherof, our ſatisfaction is accepted and allowed of god, who of his infinite goodnes, and for Chriſtes ſake, is ſatiſfied, that is to ſay, pleaſed with that littell we do.</p>
                  <p>Whervpon after this contrition had in harte, confeſſion made with mouth, and ſatiſfaction ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and promiſed, the penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may deſire to here of the miniſter, the comfortable wordes of remyſſion of ſynnes. And the miniſter thervpon, according to
<pb facs="tcp:11197:34"/>
Chriſtes goſpell, pronounce the ſentence of abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vnto the whiche abſolution, the penitent muſt gyue credence, and beleue with a perfite fayth, that his ſynnes be now forgyuen frely, by the merites of Chriſtes paſſion, to the whiche forgyuenes, he hath recourſe by the ſacrament of penance, as he had at the firſte entrie vnto Chriſtis religion by the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo to be noted, that confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the prieſt is in the church profitably commanded to be vſed, and frequented, for many other good cauſes, &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for this cauſe, that they whiche by cuſtome be drowned in ſynne, &amp; ſe not the abhomination and fil thines therof, ne remembre the goodnes of god, and want therfore contrition, may by a good goſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be ſtirred and moued, to deteſte &amp; lament their ſinne, by declaring vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word of god in ſuch ſcriptures, as ſerue for that purpoſe, in ſuche wyſe, that not only contrition ſhal ariſe in the hart, to the pleaſure of god, but alſo ſatisfaction enſue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with goddis merciful goodnes ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. So that the wordes of abſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to the penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, of the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſynnes.</p>
                  <p>Fynally it is to be remembred, that not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dynge this waye before deſcribed, is the ordinary meane, for penitent ſynners, to opteine remiſſion of ſynnes, &amp; to be reconciled to the fauour of god, yet in caſe there lacke a miniſter, to pronounce the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of abſolution, or in tyme of neceſſitie, whan a ſinner hath not ſufficient leyſure or oportunitie to do the workes of penance before declared, if he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:11197:34"/>
repent him of his ſinful life, and withal his hart, purpoſe through goddis grace to change &amp; amende the ſame, he ſhal vndoubtedly haue pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyuenes of all his miſſedoynges. For as ſaynt Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian ſayeth: Euen in the houre of deathe, whan the ſoule is ready to departe out of the body, the greate mercifull goodnes of god deſpiſeth not penaunce: In ſo muche that than, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of ſinne, nor the ſhortenes of tyme, nor yet the enormitie of lyfe, excludeth from the mercy of god, if there be tru contrition, and an vnfayned chaunge of the harte from ſynnefull conuerſation. The theſe that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon the croſſe, aſked mercye with a contryte harte, and forthwith was made a citezen of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and where as he deſerued condemnation &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhement, this contrite hart, changed his peyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to martyrdome, and his bloude into baptiſme. yet not withſtandyng, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought vpon hope of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis mercy, ſtil to continue in ſinfull lyuing. Like as no man wold be ſycke in his body, vpon hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer helth. For ſuch as wyll not forſake theyr wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and yet thinke that god wyl forgyue them, be oftentymes, ſo preuented with the iuſte plage of god, that neither they haue time to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert, nor grace to receyue the benefitte of forgyueneſſe.

It is therfore neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry, that in the vſyng, receiuing, &amp; beholding of this ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we haue harty reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, of our moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing &amp; dere ſauiour Ieſu Chriſte, that is to ſay, that we thinke effectuouſly of his moſt bitter paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che he being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord of glory ſuffred for vs. And to be waile our ſynnes, which were cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſayd death &amp; paſſion, callyng mekely for grace and the mercy of god, which moſt abundantly is obteined, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue &amp; merite of the ſame paſſion. And thinking that our lord, which gaue him ſelf in that maner for vs,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:35"/>
wyll not forſake vs, or caſt vs awaye, but forgiue vs, if we truely repent, and wyll amende, &amp; become faithfull ſeruantes to hym, whiche ſo derely hath bought vs, &amp; paied for vs, neither golde ne yet ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (as ſainte Peter ſaith) but his owne precious bloud. Wherfore, ſeinge we be ſo bought,<note place="margin">i.

                  <p>Therfore when ſo euer we ſhall receyue or vſe this holy ſacrament, we muſt take hede, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerence to the maieſtie therof, and beware that we come not vnworthely thervnto.<note place="margin">i.

And further truly, ſenſe chriſten men ought to haue remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god, whenſoeuer they go, to theyr bodely meate or drinke, &amp; receiue it not without thanckes giuing vnto god (as ſaint Paule ſaith) <hi>whether ye eate or drink or whatſoeuer ye do,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">i. Cor. x.</note> 
                     <hi>do it in the name of our lord Ieſu Chriſt:</hi> how moch more ought all chriſten men (whan they come to be fed at the table of our lorde, and to receiue this bleſſed and glorious ſacrament) to haue ſpecial &amp; entier deuotion, with moſt tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:11197:36"/>
remembrance to god, for his goodnes, declared towardes vs, in the benefite of our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore amonges other names, this ſacrament is called <hi>Euchariſtia,</hi> that is to ſaye, the ſacrament of thankes and bleſſinge. For as moche, as it ſetteth before vs, and doth exhibite vnto vs, the very price of our redemtion, and ſaluation, whiche is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our lorde that ſuffred and died for vs.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore here is to be noted, as touching the receyuyng of this ſacrament, that although our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, at the firſt inſtitution therof in his ſupper, did miniſter it vnto his diſciples tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preſent, vnder both the kindes of bread &amp; wine: Yet that faſcion &amp; maner of miniſtring is not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry to the receyuer, excepte it be to the prieſt whan he conſecrateth, that without the due obſeruation of that waye, man myghte not receyue that bleſſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to his ſaluation. For the benefite or hurt that cometh to a chriſten man by receyuing of this ſacrament, ſtandeth not in the faſcion or maner of receiuing of it, vnder one or both kindes, but in the worthy or vnworthy receiuing of the ſame. For he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> receiueth this ſacrament worthely, vnder the one kinde, as vnder the fourme of bread only, receyueth the hole body and bloud of Chriſte, &amp; as many and great benefites of Chriſt, as he that receyueth it in both kindes. And therfore if any man ſhuld teache, that the lay people (which by the ordinance &amp; anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome of the catholike church haue vſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue this holy ſacrament in fourme of bread only) be ſeduced, &amp; ſo cauſe them to thynke, that the hole
<pb facs="tcp:11197:36"/>
body and bloud of Chriſte were not comprehended in that onely forme of breade, as wel as in both the kyndes, this doctrine ought vtterly to be refuſed and abiected, as a peſtiferous &amp; a diuelyſhe ſchole. For ſurely ſcripture teacheth the contrary. And alſo naturall reaſon, although it can not comprehende the hole myſtery of this ſacrament, yet herein it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs agreably with ſcripture, that the lyuely body can not be without bloude, and ſo men oughte to be ledde from that fonde opinion (if any ſuche be) bothe by that faythe and credyte they owe to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in this poynte alſo by naturall reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore chriſten men ought not to grudge at this fourme and maner of receyuyng of this ſacramente vnder one kynde, vſed and allowed by the catholike churche, both to auoyde that errour afore reherſed, and alſo for many other weyghty conſiderations, concernyng bothe the honour of the ſacrament, and the libertie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of the hole churche. And not onely laye men, but alſo prieſtes (ſauyng whan they conſecrate) vſe to receyue this ſacrament none otherwyſe. Let chriſten men therfore, humbly apply them ſelfe, to put all erronious fantaſies (if any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che aryſe) cleane out of theyr hartes, and ſatiſfye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues with this, that whan they receyue this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worthely, thoughe it be but in one kynd, they loſe no parte of the profite and benefite promiſed by vertue of the ſayde ſacrament.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore conſideryng (as is afore reherſed (the dignitie and excellency of this ſacrament, we ought with all humblenes of harte and deuotion, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare

our ſelues, that we (vſynge accordyngly the ſame) maye be partakers of ſuche fruite and grace, as vndoubtedly is offered and gyuen to all ſuche, as in due maner receyue this ſacramente. For they that ſo doo, be made one with Chriſte, and dwelle in hym, and he in them, as he ſayeth in the .vi. chapter of ſaynt Iohns goſpell, where he ſpeaketh alſo of this ſacrament: <hi>This is the breade whiche deſcended from heauen, that who ſo euer eateth therof ſhuld not dye, I am the liuely bread, which haue deſcended from heauen, if any ſhall eate of this breade, he ſhall lyue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtyngly.</hi> And than he declaryng him ſelfe, what he meaneth by the breade, ſayeth, as incontinentely foloweth: <hi>And the breade, whiche I ſhall gyue, is my fleſhe, whiche I ſhall gyue for the lyfe of the worlde.</hi> Whiche wordes be moſte comfortable, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte confirmation and eſtabliſhment of our faythe in this ſacrament: For as muche as they bothe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vs, that his very fleſhe, bloudde, and bodye, is that meate, whiche we receiue in the ſacrament, and that alſo it preſerueth from deathe, and conferreth lyfe to all,<note place="margin">Math. ix.</note> whiche duelye receyue it. For ſeyng it is the very body of our ſauiour Chriſt, whiche is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and knytte to his godheade in one perſone, and by reaſon therof, hath the very vertue and ſubſtance of lyfe in it, it muſt nedes conſequently, by the moſt holy and bleſſed participation of the ſame, giue and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate lyfe alſo to them, that worthely receyue it: And it endueth them with grace, ſtrength, &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, againſt all temptation, ſinne, and death, &amp; doth much eaſe, and relieue all the troubles dieaſes and
<pb facs="tcp:11197:37"/>
infirmities of theyr ſoule. For ſeynge the woman, which was diſeaſed with the fluxe of bloud (as it is written in the goſpell) was healed, by touchyng the hemme of the garment of Chriſte, through the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whiche came from hym: Howe muche more ſhall they fynde remedy of the ſickenes &amp; malady of theyr ſoule, whiche with due reuerece and faythe receyue and eate the bleſſed body of Chriſte, and ſo be made lyuely temples of hym, dwellynge in theym, yea made as one fleſhe and body with him? For this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly meate is not tourned into our ſubſtaunce, as other corporall meate is, but by the godly operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therof, we be tourned towardes the nature of it, that is to ſaye, of earthely, corruptible, and ſynfull, we be made heauenly ſpirituall, and ſtrong agaynſt ſynne, and all wyckednes.</p>
                  <p>And further it is to be remembred, that as in the receyuyng of this ſacrament, we haue moſte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tter communion with Chriſte: ſo be we alſo ioyned by the ſame, in moſt perfite vnitie with his churche, and all the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bres therof.

                  </p>
                  <p>Fynally it is to be noted, that although Chriſt at the fyrſte inſtitution of this ſacrament, dyd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and giue it to his diſciples, at ſupper, after they had eaten the paſchal lambe, partly to declare that the ſacramentes and ſacrifices of the old lawe, ſhuld from thensforth ceaſſe and take an ende, and partly, that by this ſacrament, being the laſt thing that he nexte before his deathe, lefte vnto his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of him ſhuld be the more depe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectuouſly imprinted in the hartes of them and of all other, that after ſhulde receyue the ſame: Yet (as ſaint Auguſtine ſaith) it was thought good to the apoſtles and the vniuerſall churche, beynge moued with the holy goſte, for the more honour of ſo high a ſacrament, and for the more reuerence and deuout receyuynge therof, that it ſhulde alwayes be receyued of chriſten people, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be faſtyng, and before they receyue any bodily ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, except it be in caſe of ſyckenes or neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore conſidering the moſt excellent grace, efficacy, and vertu of this ſacrament, it were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wyſhed and prayed for, that al chriſten peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had ſuche deuotion thervnto, that they wolde gladly diſpoſe and prepare themſelues, to the more often worthy receyuynge of the ſame.

<pb facs="tcp:11197:40"/>
perſon in trinitie, deſcendyng from his father, dyd take vpon him the very forme and ſubſtance of our nature, and ſo theſe two natures were vnited and knyt togither in one perſone: but alſo therby is ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnified and repreſented, the ſocietie and coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in perfite and indiſſoluble loue and charitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Chriſt and his church, that is to ſay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of al chriſten people. And this to be true ſaynt Paule him ſelfe affirmeth in the fyſt chapy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the epiſtle vnto the Epheſians. In whiche place the apoſtle myndynge to proue and perſwade, that al women, beyng marryed, oughte to loue, to reuerence, to honour, to obeye, to be ſubiecte vnto theyr huſbandes in all thinges, euen as the church is ſubiect vnto Chriſte: and lykewyſe that all huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes ought and be bounde to loue theyr wyues, euen as they loue theyr owne ſelfe and theyr owne bodies, and euen as Chriſte loueth the churche his eſpouſe: He bringeth in the firſt inſtitution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonye, as it was ordeyned by god in Paradiſe, and alledgeth the wordes of god as they be before reherſed: vpon whiche wordes the apoſtle inferreth and ſaythe. This coniunction of man and woman togither in mariage, wherby they are knytted, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made al one fleſhe and one body, <hi>Is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> that is to ſaye: a myſtery and ſignification of that great and meruaylous coniunction, whiche is betwene Chriſte and his churche. For lyke as by vertue and efficacy of the fyrſt inſtitution of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the huſbande and the wyfe be made to be but one body, wherof the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is hed: Euen ſo Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:11197:41"/>
doth knytte and vnite, conglutinate and make his churche to be one body with hym, wherof he is the very head.

And that this coniunction betweene Chriſt and the churche, is the very ſelfe thing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is ſignified and repreſented by the other coniun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction of man and woman in mariage. For thoughe ſaynt Paule vſed in this place, other argumentes &amp; perſuaſions, taken of the lawe of nature, to enduce maried ꝑſons, the one to loue the other, ſaying that men naturally do loue and nouriſhe their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and their owne fleſſhe: Yet he vſeth this as a reaſon of great efficacye, to perſuade his purpoſe, that is to ſay, that all huſbandes and wiues ought ſo to vſe them ſelues, the one to the other, that their matrimony and all their workes and affections in the ſame, myght and ſhuld correſponde, and be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable and like vnto that moſte holy thyng, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is ſignified and repreſented thereby, that is to ſay, vnto that ſpirituall coniunction, whiche is be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twene Chriſt and his eſpouſe the churche. And that therefore eſpecially, the man ought and is bound to loue his wife, and the wyfe to loue and obeye her huſbande in all thinges, leſt by doinge the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they ſhuld make their matrimony vnlike to the thing that is ſignified therby.</p>
                  <p>And thus was matrimony not onely inſtituted
<pb facs="tcp:11197:41"/>

                  <p>Chriſt puttyng the ſaid phariſees in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of the firſt inſtitution of matrimony ſayd vnto them: Haue you not red, how that god whiche created all thynges in the beginning, did alſo forme and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate man and woman, &amp; ſaid theſe wordes: Therfore the man ſhal leaue his father and mother, and ſhal adhere and cleaue vnto his wyfe, &amp; they ſhalbe two in one fleſhe &amp; one body? Wherfore vnderſtand you (ſaith he) that ſith man &amp; woman conioyned in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, be by goddis ordinance but one fleſhe and one body, they ſhuld not afterward be ſeparated or diuorced one from the other. And vnderſtande you alſo that it is not laufull for any man, to ſeparate and diuide thoſe perſons a ſunder, whiche by god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis worde and his wyl and power be conioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither.
<pb facs="tcp:11197:42"/>
And whan the phariſees replying thervnto ſayde: Why than dyd Moyſes commande vs, to make a lybell of diuorce, and ſo to departe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our ſelues from our wyues? Chriſte anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them and ſayd. Moiſes conſydering the harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and obſtynacy of your hartes, dyd permyt and ſuffre you ſo to do. Howe be it I ſay vnto you, that it was not ſo at the beginnynge, that is to ſay, it is cleane contrary to the godly inſtitution and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall order of the lawes of matrimony, as it was in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtituted by god at the beginning, that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſhulde be diuorced from his lawfull wyfe, and be ſet at libertie to marry. And therfore I ſay again vnto you, that who ſo euer doth forſake his laufull wyfe, onles it be for adultery, commytted by her, and mary an other, I ſay he commytteth adulterye in ſo doinge, And lykewiſe what woman ſoo euer doth forſake her laufull huſbande, and marrieth an other, ſhe alſo committeth adultery, and the man alſo that marrieth her offendeth in like maner.</p>
                  <p>Theſe wordes of Chriſte euydently declare his ſentence in the approbation of the inſtytution of matrimony, made at the beginning of the worlde, and that it is Chriſtes wyll and commaundement, that the people of god ſhulde folowe and conforme theyr doinges vnto the lawes of matrimonye than made, &amp; ſhuld obſerue the ſame in ſuch purity &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>timony, as it was fyrſt ordeyned, without ſeparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or diuorce, &amp; that vnder the peyne of damnation.</p>
                  <p>And here alſo is one thing ſpecially to be noted that in theſe wordes of Chriſte, <hi>(That, whiche god
<pb facs="tcp:11197:42"/>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of god is, that you ſhoulde ſanctify your ſelues, that is to ſaye, that you ſhulde abſteyn from all maner of fornication, and that euery one of you ſhulde vſe and keepe the veſſelle of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:43"/>
in holyneſſe and honour, and not in deſyre of carnall concupiſcence, lyke as the Gentyles doo, whiche know not god, and that no man ſhuld craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyly compas and circumuent his brother, to obtein his fleſſhely luſtes: For almighty god taketh ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon all ſuche people, as do committe any of thoſe thinges. Knowe you alſo, that god hath not called vs to vncleannes and fylthynes of lyfe, but vnto holines and ſantimonie. And therfore I do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte you all, and in the name of god commaunde you, to eſchue all fornication and adultery, all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe and carnall concupiſcence, all fylthynes and vnpure lyuynge in fleſſhely luſtes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And I ſaye further, that who ſo euer deſpyſeth and breaketh theſe my commandementes, doth not deſpiſe me, but deſpiſeth god: For they be his com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundementes, whoſe ſpirite ye haue receyued.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond good thyng, which ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the ſaid ſacrament, is the faith and mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuall promyſe, made betwene the huſbande and the wyfe, conioyned in lawful matrimony. wherby and by the vertue of the ſayde ſacrament, the perſons ſo laufully conioyned, be bound eſche one to kepe pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myſe with the other, according to ſuch truſt and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fydence, as eche had in the other, and expreſſed by wordes in the ſame contracte, whiche promiſe god did aſſiſte and ratifie, and is now partie thervnto: ſo that the breach of that promyſe and faith, is now a high and diſpleaſant offence vnto almighty god, lyke as the obſeruation and keping therof, is in the ſyght of god, pleaſant, acceptable, and meritorious
<pb facs="tcp:11197:44"/>
and the knotte alſo and bonde of matrimony, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted betwene the ſayde perſons, is made therby to be indiſſoluble. Trouthe it is, that if in any ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage, it may appere, and be duly proued, that there is ſuche inſufficient impediment, by the lawes of god, or by the lawes of the realme, that the ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trymony was at the beginning vnlauful, &amp; of none effect: in that caſe, the church may and ought, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce the ſame perſons ſo vnlaufully contracted, &amp; declare, that ſuche matrimony is vnlauful, and the bonde therof, to be of no ſtrengthe or efficacie, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe is was neuer good from the beginninge. Not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtandyng, in mariages laufully made, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the ordinance of matrimonye, preſcribed by god and the lawes of euery realm, the bond ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of can not be diſſolued, durynge the liues of the par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties, betwene whom ſuch matrimony is made.</p>
                  <p>The thirde good thyng to be conſydered and obſerued in matrimony, is the child that cometh of maryage, and the good and vertuous education and bringynge vp of the ſame. Whervnto all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men &amp; women ought to haue a ſpeciall regard, and to folowe therin the example of Thoby,<note place="margin">Tobi. iiii.</note> which taught his ſonne from his infancie, to loue &amp; dread god, &amp; to flee &amp; abſteine from all maner of ſinne, for goddis ſake. For ſurely if the fathers and mothers be negligent in good bringing vp of their children in their youth, and ſuffer them to fal in to folies and ſynne, in defaut of due correction and chaſtiſement of them for the ſame: no doubte they ſhal aunſwere vnto god for it, as it appereth by the greate ſtroke and

                  <p>And therfore let all parentes emply theyr dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and buſy cure, to educate and inſtructe their children, by al meanes in vertue &amp; goodnes, &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them from vices, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient diſcipline and caſtigation, according to the ſaying of the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: Withdraw not thy iuſt diſcipline fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy child, for if thou do ſo, he wyll fall into ſundry inconueniences,<note place="margin">Pro. xx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb facs="tcp:11197:46"/>And for as moche as it is an olde hereſie of the Donatiſtes, condemned in the generall counſelles, to thynke that the worde of god, and his ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſhuld be of no efficacy, ſtrength, or vertue, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be miniſtred by euyll men, it is to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, that according to the ſaying of ſaynt Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene: Lyke as there is no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwene the ſelfe ſame image or figure of any thyng imprinted with a ſignet of golde, and a ſignet made of yron, or of woode, or any other viler mattier: euen ſo the worde of god, and the ſacramentes of god myny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by an euyll and noughty man, be of the ſelfe ſame vygour, ſtrength, and efficacie, as whan they be miniſtred by a man of excellent vertu and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. The cauſe and reaſon wherof is, for that the prieſtes and byſhops, although in the execution of their office and adminiſtration, they do vſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the power and auctoritie of god, committed vnto them: yet they be not the principall cauſers, nor the ſufficient, or of them ſelues the efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſers or gyuers of grace, or of any other ſpirituall gyfte, whiche procedeth and is gyuen of god, by his word and his ſacramentes. But god is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principall, ſufficient, and perfite cauſe of all the efficacy of his worde, and his ſacramentes, and by his only power, grace, and benefites it is, that we receyue the holy goſte, and his gracis, by the office and adminiſtration of the ſaid prieſtes and byſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, and the ſayde prieſtes and byſſhoppes be but onely as officers, to execute and miniſter with their handes and tongues, the outwarde and corporall
<pb facs="tcp:11197:46"/>
thynges, wherein god worketh and gyueth grace inwarde, accordynge to his pacte and couenaunt, made with and to his eſpouſe, the church. And this alſo Chriſoſtome affirmeth the .lxxxv. homily vpon ſaynt Iohn, where he ſayth in this maner: What ſpeake I of prieſtis, I ſay that neyther aungel nor archangell can giue vs any of theſe thynges, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che be giuen vnto vs of god, but it is the father, the ſonne, and the holy goſte, whiche is the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe of all theſe thynges, the prieſt dothe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put to his handes, and his tongue. And in this poynt ſaynt Ambroſe alſo agreeth, with the ſayde ſayinges of Chriſoſtome wrytyng thus. The prieſt layeth his handes vpon vs, but it is god, that gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the grace, the prieſt layeth vpon vs his beſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge handes, but god bleſſeth vs with his migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty hande. The byſhoppe conſecrateth an other byſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe, but it is god that gyueth the worthyneſſe. Wherfore we muſt always thynke and beleue, that the vertue and efficacie of the word of god, and his ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, conſiſteth and dependeth, in and vpon the commandement, ordinance, power, and aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of god onely, and that neyther the merites or worthynes of the miniſters, be they neuer of ſuche excellencie, do gyue them theyr auctoritie, ſtrength, or effycacie, neyther yet the malyce, nor corrupte lyuynge of them, be it neuer ſo euyll, can fruſtrate or take away from the ſayde worde or ſacramentes, their ſayd power, authoritie, ſtrength, or vertue.</p>

                     <hi>Deacons oughte to be chaſte, not double tounged, no drunkardes, not gredy of fylthy lucre, hauynge the myſtery of faythe in a pure conſcience.</hi> And their office in the primitiue churche, was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in myniſtringe meate and drynke, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaryes, to poore people founde of the churche, partly alſo in mynyſtrynge to the byſſhoppes and prieſtes, and in doinge theyr duetie in the churche. And of theſe two orders onely, that is to ſaye, prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and deacons, ſcripture maketh expreſſe menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and howe they were conferred of the apoſtels by prayer and impoſition of their handes. And to theſe two, the primitiue churche did adde &amp; conioyn certain other inferiour and lower degrees, as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons, accolites, exorciſtes, with diuerſe other, of the whiche mention is made of bothe of the moſt auncient writers, that we haue in the churche of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> after the apoſtelles, and alſo in diuerſe olde counſayles, and namely in the fourthe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle of Aphrike, in whiche ſaynte Auguſtine was preſent, where as all the kyndes of orders, whiche were than in the churche, be reherſed, and alſo with what rites and ceremonies, they were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ferred and giuen at that time. And thus by ſucceſſion from the apoſtles time hath Order continued in the churche and hath euer bene called and counted for a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:48"/>
as it may appere by dyuers other aunciente writers, and ſpeciallye by ſainte Auguſtine, where he writeth thus, ſpeakinge bothe of the ſacrament of baptiſme, and of order: Eyther of them (ſaythe he) is a ſacrament, and eyther of them is gyuen to men, by a certain conſecration, the one whan a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is baptiſed, and the other, whan he is ordered, and therfore neyther of them both, may be iterate or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted in the catholyke churche of Chriſte.</p>
                  <p>And where as we haue thus ſummaryly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what is the office and miniſtration, whiche in holy ſcriptures hath ben committed to byſſhoppes and prieſtes, and in what thinges it conſiſteth, as is afore reherſed, leſte peraduenture it myghte be thoughte to ſome perſones, that ſuche auctorities, powers, and iurisdictions, as patriarches, pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, archebyſſhoppes, and metropolitanes, now haue, or heretofore at any time haue had iuſtly and laufully ouer other byſhoppes, were gyuen theym by god in holy ſcripture. We thynke it expediente and neceſſarye, that all men ſhulde be aduertiſed and taught, that all ſuche laufull powers and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of any one byſſhoppe ouer an other, were and be gyuen to them, by the conſent, ordynaunce, and poſytiue lawes of men onely, and not by any ordynaunce of god in holy ſcripture. And all other power and authoritie, whiche any byſſhoppe hath vſed or exercyſed ouer an other, whyche hathe not benne gyuen to hym by ſuche conſente and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynaunce of menne, (as is aforeſayde) is in verye deede noo laufull power, but plaine vſurpation
<pb facs="tcp:11197:49"/>
and tyrannye.</p>
                  <p>And therfore where as the byſhoppe of Rome, hath heretofore claymed &amp; vſurped, to be head and gouernour of all prieſtes and byſhops of the hole catholyke churche of Chriſte, by the lawes of god: It is euydent, that the ſame power is vtterly fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and vntrue, and was neyther gyuen to hym by god in his holy ſcripture, nor allowed by the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers in the auncient generall counſels, nor yet by the conſent of the hole catholyke churche. For it is playne, that Chriſte neuer gaue vnto ſaint Peter, or to any of the apoſtels, or theyr ſucceſſours, any ſuche vniuerſall authoritie ouer all the other. But he ſet them all indifferently, and in lyke power, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnitie, and authoritie, as it dothe euidently appere in all ſuche places, where any authoritie is gyuen to them by Chriſte. And alſo by ſainte Paule, in his epiſtle to the Galathians, where he compareth him ſelfe to Iames,<note place="margin">Gala. ii.</note> Peter, and Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche were the moſt notable emonge the apoſtles, affirminge hym ſelfe to be equall in authoritie with them.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the moſt auncient and moſt famouſe holy generall counſayles, it is euydent, that they gaue the byſhops of Rome, no ſuche au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, for in them be dyuerſe actes and decres, playnely teſtifieng the contrary.</p>
                  <p>As fyrſt in the former counſaile of Nece, emonge other, there is one decree, that the patriarches of A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lexandria, &amp; Antiochia, ſhuld haue like power ouer the countreys about thoſe citees, as the byſhoppes

                  <p>Alſo in the counſayle Mileuitane, in which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayle ſaint Auguſtine was preſente, and ſubſcribed to the ſame, it was decreed, that if any clerke of the countreys of Aphrike, wolde appeale out of Aphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, vnto any byſſhoppes beyonde the ſea, that ſuche a one ſhulde be taken through out al the countreys of Aphrica, as a perſon excommunicate.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer in the general counſayle Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinopolitan the fyrſte, it was likewyſe decreed, that euery cauſe and controuerſy betwene any perſons, ſhulde be determined within the prouinces, where the matters dyd lye, and that by the byſhops of the ſame prouinces. And alſo that no byſhops ſhuld ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any power out of his own dioces or prouince. And this was alſo the mynde of the holy doctour and martyr ſaint Cypriane, and of the other holye fathers of Aphrica, before the tyme of any generall counſayle.</p>
                  <p>And for the better and more playne and aſſured confirmation, that the biſhop of Rome hath no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che vniuerſall authoritie, neyther by goddis lawe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne yet by any ordinances of any ancient catholyke cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle: It is to be conſidered, that in the .vi. great counſayle Carthaginenſe, the biſhop of Rome ſente his legates to that counſaile, to alledge and vendi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cate his vſurped primacy, and by title of the ſame, to defend and mainteine the receyuing of appeles made vnto hym of cauſes and controuerſies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in Aphrike, bycauſe the hole counſaile had
<pb facs="tcp:11197:50"/>
by theyr decree, prohibited &amp; forbidden before, al ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che appeles to any toreyn byſhop. In the entreting and debatyng of which matter, the biſhop of Rome for his title, alleged onely a canon, made (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tended) in the firſte Nicene counſaile, The biſhops of Aphrica denieng any ſuch canon to be made. For triall wherof, meſſangers were ſent to the patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſees of the orient, to make ſearche for the hole canons of that counſayle. And finally after longe &amp; dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſearche, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hole canons were brought forthe from thenſe, there was no ſuch canon emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them, as the byſhop of Rome for his ſayde title had alledged.</p>
                  <p>Whervpon two thynges are to be noted, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident by the premiſſes. Firſte that the biſhoppe of Rome hath no ſuch primacy, nor any ſuch can chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge by any wordes in ſcripture: For than the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome wolde at that tyme by his legates haue alleged it, and the great multitude of ſo many fathers, as were aſſembled in that Aphrican coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle (of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaynt Auguſtine was one) were ſo wel &amp; profoundly lerned in holy ſcripture, that no ſuch thynge (if it were there) coulde haue ben hidde vnto them. And alſo they were ſoo good and vertuouſe, that if they had knowen it there, they than wolde haue made no acte before to the contrary, nor yet at that tyme, ſo erneſtly and extremely refuſed it.</p>
                  <p>The ſeconde thyng to be noted as euident by the premiſſes is, that the byſhops of Rome, haue no ſuche power giuen them by any auncient generall counſayle. For they at that tyme of this Aphicane
<pb facs="tcp:11197:50"/>
counſayle, wold than haue alleged it, where in dede they alleged none but a pretenſed canon of the fyrſt Nicene counſayle, which after great trial &amp; ſearche as is aforeſayde, coulde neuer be founde in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentikes. And that chapiter autentique, which of al the canons of that counſayle moſte concerneth the biſhop of Rome, maketh directly &amp; playnly againſt the ſayde pretenſed vniuerſal primacy, giuyng (as is ſaide before) to other patriarches, lyke and equal authoritie in theyr countreys, as biſhops of Rome had and vſed than in the countreis about Rome.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly that the biſhops of Rome had no ſuch vniuerſall primacy gyuen vnto them by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the hole catholyke church, it wel appereth in that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyuers patriarches &amp; archebyſſhops haue of ancient tyme refuſed, to owe vnto them any ſuch ſubiection, as they by colour of an vniuerſal prima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry chalenged &amp; required ouer them. As the patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Conſtantinople &amp; other of the eaſt, &amp; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chebiſſhops of Rauenna, Millan, &amp; ſuch other. And alſo Agatho him ſelfe being biſhop of Rome, longe after the .iiii. fyrſt vniuerſall counſayles, in his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent vnto the emperour, concerning a generall counſaile to be holden at Conſtantinople, playnely declareth and confeſſeth his primacy to extend one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the byſhops of the weſte &amp; north parties: And that in ſuche wiſe, as it is euident, that at that tyme the biſhops of Rome, neither by the wordes of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, nor by any decree of ancient generall cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſels, nor by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the hole catholyke churche, had any ſuch vniuerſall primacy, as he nowe requireth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:11197:51"/>And yf the byſſhops of Rome, wyll allege any later counſayles, for their pretenſed vniuerſall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, as the counſayles, of Conſtance, Baſill, and Florence: It is manyfeſt and open, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes of Baſill and Conſtance were in the tyme of ſciſmes, and they which were there deuided in to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, after the fauour of their princis, which prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cis were alſo deuided, ſome fauouring the one part of the ſciſme, ſome the other. And the great part of the lerned men that were there, were of this later in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitute religious, and therfore obſequente to the pleaſure and wyll of the biſhoppes of Rome, and brought vp only in this later ſcolaſticall doctrine, and lytell exerciſed or lerned in the holy ſcriptures, or in the olde auncient doctours and writers. And bothe of thoſe counſayles were dyſſolued and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, without any perfit ende or concluſion. And ſith that tyme, the canons pragmatical of theſe two counſayles, be no where vſed, nor yet alleged, as to be of effecte, by the authoritie of thoſe counſayles. And as to the counſayle Florentine, ouer and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſides, that the greatteſt parte of lerned men there, were ſuche, as we ſpake of before, the conſent alſo in this matter, of the Orientalles and Grecians, that were there, ſeemed to the hole countreyes that ſent them, ſo farre bothe agaynſt ſcripture, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral counſayles, and their auncient holy writers, that they forthwith ſhewed them ſelues ſoo moche diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with that conſent of theyr ambaſſadours, that they then neyther wold receiue the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning the vniuerſall primacy of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<pb facs="tcp:11197:51"/>
of Rome, neyther ſithe that tyme coulde be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to agree to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>And thus by all thoſe thinges before reherſed, it plainly appereth, that the biſhops of Rome, clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this pretenſed vniuerſall primacie, do yet not onely without any grounde of holy ſcripture, and without any conſent of the hole catholike churche, but alſo contrary to the determination and decrees of ſuche generall counſayles, as the biſſhoppes of Rome, theſe many hundred yeres vnto this day, in theyr creation do ſolemnely and expreſſely profeſſe to kepe &amp; obſerue. For as it appereth by theyr owne lawes and actes from tyme to tyme, euery byſſhop of Rome, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is created, doth openly &amp; ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe, that he ſhall inuiolably obſerue &amp; kepe all the canons of the fyrſt .viii. generall counſailes, amonge the whyche be the canons before reherſed, playnely repugnant and contrary to his ſayde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſed vniuerſall primacy.</p>
                  <p>Fynally this beynge manifeſtly declared and proued, that the byſhoppes of Rome, hath not iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and laufully any ſuche vniuerſal power ouer the byſſhoppes and clergy, al wyſe men may eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyue and ſee, that they maye moche leſſe clayme to haue the hole monarchye of the worlde, and ſuch authoritie ouer all princes and kynges, that they may therby depoſe them from theyr realmes, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and ſeignories, and transferre and gyue the ſame vnto ſuch perſons, as them liketh. Where as the ſcripture dothe teache and commaunde the contrary, that is to ſaye: That all chriſten people
<pb facs="tcp:11197:52"/>
as well prieſtis and biſhops, as all other, ſhulde be obedient vnto princes and poteſtates of the world. For the truth is, that god conſtituted and ordeined the authoritie of chriſten kynges and princes, to be the moſt high and ſupreme, aboue all other powers and officers in this worlde, in the regiment and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of theyr people, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto them, as vnto the chiefe heades of theyr co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealthes, the cure and ouerſight of all the people, which be in theyr realmes, and dominions, without any excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And to them of right, and by goddis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, belongeth not only to prohibite vnlawfull violence, to correcte offendours by corporall death or other puniſhment, to conſerue morall honeſty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge theyr ſubiectes, accordinge to the lawes of theyr realmes, to defend iuſtice, &amp; to procure the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike wele &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon peace &amp; tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillitie in outward &amp; earthly thinges: But ſpecially and principally to defende the faith of Chriſt, and his religion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue and maintein the true doctrine of Chriſte, and all ſuche as be true preachers and ſetters forth ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of, &amp; to aboliſhe all abuſes, hereſies, and idolatries, and to puniſhe with corporal peines, ſuch as of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice be the occaſion of the ſame. And finally to ouer ſee and cauſe that the ſayd biſhops &amp; prieſtes, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute their paſtoral office truely &amp; faithfully, &amp; ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ally in thoſe pointes, which by Chriſt and his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, were giuen and committed vnto them: and in caſe they ſhall be negligent in any parte therof, or wolde not diligently execute the ſame, to cauſe them to redoube and ſupply theyr lacke. And if they obſti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nately
<pb facs="tcp:11197:52"/>
withſtand theyr princes kynd monition, and wyll not amend theyr faultes, than and in ſuch caſe to put other in theyr roumes and places. And god hath alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded the ſayd biſhops &amp; prieſtes, to obey with all humblenes &amp; reuerence, both kynges and princis, and gouernours, and all theyr lawes not beynge contrary to the lawes of god, what ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, and that not onely <hi>propter iram,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>propter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcientia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is to ſay, not only for feare of punyſhment, but alſo for diſcharge of conſcience. Wherby it appereth well, that this pretended mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of the biſhop of Rome, is not founded vpon the goſpell, but it is repugnant thervnto.</p>
                  <p>And therfore it apperteyneth to chriſten kinges and princis, for the diſcharge of theyr office &amp; dutie towarde god, to endeuour them ſelues to refourme and reduce the ſame againe vnto the olde limittes and priſtine eſtate of that power, which was giuen to them by Chriſte, &amp; vſed in the primitiue churche. For it is out of doubt, that Chriſtis faith was than moſt firme and pure, &amp; the ſcriptures of god, were than beſte vnderſtande, and vertue dyd than moſte abounde &amp; excel. And therfore it muſt nedes folow, that the cuſtomes and ordynaunces than vſed and made be more conforme and agreable vnto the true doctrine of Chriſt and more conducynge vnto the edifieng and benefite of the churche of Chriſt, than any cuſtome or lawes vſed or made by the byſſhop of Rome, or any other addicted to that ſee and vſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped power, ſith that tyme.</p>
                  <p>And therfore where as the kynges moſte royall

                  <p>Surely we haue great cauſe, moſt ioyfully and thankefully to enbrace and accepte the ſame, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deryng that therby no preiudice is done to goddis worde or his ordinaunces. For as we haue ſhewed and declared before, it was by princes ſufferaunce onely, that the byſſhoppe of Rome, exerciſed any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che iurisdiction within this realme, and not by the authoritie giuen vnto hym by Chriſte. And as for the byſſhop of Rome, he can not pretende hym ſelfe no more to be greued or iniuried therwith, than any of the kynges officers myght worthily thynke, that the kynges byghnes ſhulde do him wronge, in caſe he ſhulde vppon good cauſe, remoue hym from his roume and office, and committe it to an other.

                  <p>And therfore it is to be noted, that to haue god, is not to haue hym, as we haue other outwarde thynges, as clothes vpon our backe, or treaſure in our cheſtes, nor alſo to haue him in our mouth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, or to worſhyp hym with knelynge, or ſuche other geſtures onely: but to haue hym our god, is to conceyue hym in our hartes, to cleaue faſte and ſurely vnto hym, with harte and mynde, to put all our truſt &amp; confidence in him, to ſet all our though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and care aboue all thynges to pleaſe hym, and to depend holely of hym, takyng him to be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good and mercyfull vnto vs, beynge his creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and continuyng in his flocke.</p>
                  <p>Secondly god commandeth vs thus to do to hym onely, and to no creature, nor to no falſe and fayned god. For as a kynde and louynge man, can

<pb facs="tcp:11197:71"/>
in right charitie: And alſo that all chriſten men be one body myſticall of Chriſte, as the bread is made of many graines, and yet but one lofe. Bearynge the candels on Candelmas day, dothe put vs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Chriſt, the ſpirituall lyght, of whom Symeon dyd prophecy, as is redde in the churche that daye. Gyuinge aſſhes on aſhwedneſday, doth put vs in remembrance, that euery chriſten manne ſhulde conſidre, that he is but aſhes and earth, and thervnto he ſhall retourne. Bearyng of palmes on palme ſonday, dothe put vs in remembrance of the receiuynge of Chriſte in to Hieruſalem a lyttell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his deathe, and that we muſt haue the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre to receyue him in our hartes. Crepynge to the croſſe on good friday, &amp; there offeryng vnto Chriſt before the ſame, and kyſſynge of it, declareth our humble ſubmiſſion and thankes giuynge to Chriſt for our redemption, whiche he hath wroughte for vs vpon the croſſe. And ſo finally the ſettyng vp of the ſepulchre of Chriſte, whoſe body after his death was buried: And al other like laudable cuſtomes, rites, and ceremonies do put vs in remembrance of ſome ſpiritual thyng. And therfore they be not to be contemned, and caſte away, but obediently to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and continued, as thynges good and laudable for the purpoſes aboueſaid.</p>

For ſurely no prayer is thankfull vnto god,<note place="margin">Pſ cxviii. Exod. xiiii</note> but that whiche is made with the hart. And therfore the prophet Dauid crieth to our lorde with all his hart. And Moyſes is noted to crye out aloude, whan he ſpake no word with his mouth, but he ſpake aloude with his hart. And our lord by his prophete noteth,<note place="margin">Pſal. xxix.</note> that ſome pray with theyr lyppes and in their hartes minde nothinge leſſe than that which they praye for.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the better vnderſtanding of this ſalutation of the angel, made to the bleſſed virgine Mary, ye ſhall fyrſt conſyder, how it was decreed of the hole trinitie, That after the falle of our firſte father Adam (by which mankinde was ſo long in the great indignation of god, and exiled out of heauen) the ſeconde perſon, the euerlaſtynge ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nne of the father euerlaſtyng, ſhulde take vppon him the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſo as he was perfect god ſhuld be perfect man, to redeme mankynd from the power of the deuill,<note place="margin">Luc. i.</note> and to reconcile the ſame again to his lord god. And for this purpoſe (as ſaint Luce in his goſpel declareth) in the .vi. moneth after ſaint Elizabeth was conceiued, with ſaint Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſt, the aungell Gabriel was ſent from god, into a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin, which was deſpouſed or enſured to a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe name was Ioſeph, of the houſe of Dauid, and the virgines name was Mary. And whan this angell came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſaid virgin, he ſaid theſe wordes: <hi>Hayle ful of grace, the lord is with the, bleſſed art thou emong
<pb facs="tcp:11197:102"/>
women.</hi> And whan the virgine hearing theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, was troubled with theym, and muſed with her ſelfe, what maner of ſalutation ti ſhuld be. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſayd to her: Feare not Mary, be not abaſſhed, for thou haſte founde fauour in the ſyght of god. Lo thou ſhalte conceyue in thy wombe, and ſhalte bryng forthe a ſonne, and thou ſhalt call his name <hi>IESVS,</hi> he ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the ſonne of the hygheſt. And the lorde god ſhall gyue vnto hym the ſeat of Dauid, his father, And he ſhall reigne ouer the houſe of Iacob for euer, And his kyngdome ſhal haue no ende. Than ſayd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the aungelle: Howe can this be done? for I haue not knowlege of man. And the aungelle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerynge ſaide vnto her: The holy goſt ſhall come from aboue in to the, and the power of the hygheſt ſhall ouerſhadowe the. And therfore that holy one, that ſhalbe borne of the, ſhall be called the ſonne of god: And lo thy couſyn Elyzabeth hathe alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued a ſonne in her olde age, and this is the ſyxte moneth ſythe ſhe conceyued, whiche was called the bareyn woman: for there is nothyng vnpoſſible to god. To this Mary anſwered: Lo I am the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayde of our lorde, be it done vnto me as thou haſt ſpoken. And than forthwith vpon the departure of the angell. Mary beyng newly conceyued with the moſt bleſſed childe <hi>IESVS,</hi> went vp into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes with ſpeede in to a citie of Iuda, and came to the houſe of Zacharye, and ſaluted Elyzabeth. And as ſoone as Elyzabeth hearde the ſalutation of Mary, the chylde ſprange in her wombe, and
<pb facs="tcp:11197:102"/>
furthwith Elyzabeth was replenyſhed with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goſte, and cried with a greate voyce and ſayde: <hi>Bleſſed arte thou emonge women, and bleſſed is the fruite of thy wombe.</hi> And wherof cometh this, that the mother of my lorde commeth to me? For lo, as ſoone as the voyce of thy ſalutation was in my ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, the chylde in my wombe lept for ioy. And bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed arte thou that dyddeſt beleeue, for all thynges that haue ben ſpoken to the from our lorde, ſhall be performed.</p>
               <p>Secondly it is to be noted, that the angel Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briell, which ſpake to the virgine, was an high an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and an high meſſanger. And truely it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that he ſhoulde be ſo, for he came with the higheſt meſſage, that euer was ſente, whiche was the entreaty and leage of peace betweene god and man. And therfore the fyrſt word of his ſalutation, that is to ſsye, <hi>Hayle,</hi> or be ioyfull, was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for the ſame. For he came with the meſſage of ioy, and ſo ſayde the other aungell, whiche at the byrth of our ſauiour, appered to the ſhepherdes,<note place="margin">Luc. ii.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſhewe to you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>great ioye that ſhall be to all the people.</hi> And ſurely conſyderyng the effectes that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued vpon his highe meſſage, all mankynde hadde great cauſe to ioy. For man beinge in the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpleaſure of god, was hereby reconciled, Man beinge in the bondes of the deuyll, was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by delyuered, Man beinge exiled and banyſhed out of heauen, was hereby reſtored thither againe.</p>
               <p>Theſe be ſuche matters of ioy and comforte to vs, that there neuer was or ſhall be nor can be any
<pb facs="tcp:11197:103"/>
lyke. And not onely for this purpoſe he began with this high worde of comforte, but alſo for he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the virgine being alone, wolde be moche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed and aſtonied at his maruailous and ſodeine commyng vnto her. And therfore he thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, fyrſt of all to vtter the worde of ioye and comfort, whiche might put away all feare from the bleſſed virgine. And he called her <hi>Full of grace,</hi> by god endued ſo plentuouſly, bycauſe ſhe ſhulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue and beare hym, that was the very plenytude and fulnes of grace, the lorde of grace, by whom is all grace, &amp; without whome is no grace. And this is the ſyngular grace, by which ſhe is called, not on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the mother of man, but alſo the mother of god.</p>
               <p>Thirdly by theſe wordes, <hi>The lord is with the,</hi> is declared, why the angell called her full of grace: for ſurely our lorde is not with them, that be not in grace, nor tarieth with them, that be voyd of grace and be in ſynne. For there is a ſeparation and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce betwene the ſynfull ſoule and our lord, as the wyſe man ſaythe:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Peruerſe thoughtes make a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and a diuorce from god.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly by theſe wordes, <hi>Bleſſed arte thou e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge women,</hi> was ment, that there was neuer wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo bleſſed. And truely ſhe may wel be called ſo, moſte bleſſed emong all women: for ſhe had greate and high prerogatiues, whiche none other woman euer had, hathe, or ſhall haue. Is not this an high prerogatiue, that of all women ſhe was choſen to be mother to the ſonne of god? And what excellent honour was ſhe put to, whan, not withſtandinge,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:103"/>
the decree was made of his natiuitie by the hole tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie, yet the thyng was not done and accompliſhed without or before her conſent was granted? For the whiche, ſo ſolemne a meſſanger was ſent. And alſo howe highe grace was this, that after the defaute made through the perſwaſion of the firſte woman our mother Eue, by whom Adam was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſobedience, this bleſſed virgin was electe to be the inſtrument of our reparation, in that ſhe was choſen to beare the ſauiour &amp; redemer of the world? And is not this a wonderfull prerogatiue, to ſee a virgine to be a mother, &amp; conceyue her chylde with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out ſynne? we may worthily ſay, that ſhe is the moſt bleſſed of all other women. And to thentent that all good chriſten men ſhulde repute and take her ſo: Beholde the prouidence of god, that wolde by an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother wytneſſe confirme the ſame, for euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame wordes that the aungell ſpake, the bleſſed matrone ſaint Elyzabeth ſpake alſo, and where the angell made an ende, there ſhe beganne.</p>
               <p>The angell made an end of his ſalutation, with theſe wordes, <hi>Bleſſed art thou amonge women,</hi> The bleſſed matrone began her ſalutation with the ſame wordes, declarynge that ſhe was inſpired with the ſame ſpirite, that ſent the aungell, and that they were both miniſters to the holy Trinitie, the one from heauen, the other in earth. And afterward ſhe added theſe wordes, ſaying: <hi>And bleſſed is the fruite of thy wombe.</hi> Theſe be not the wordes of the angel but of ſaint Elizabeth: For whan the vyrgin Mary came to ſalute her, the ſayd Elizabeth beyng inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:11197:104"/>
with the holy goſte, and knowyng that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Mary was conceyued, ſpake theſe wordes, of the fruite that the virgine ſhulde bring forth.</p>
               <p>And there is alſo an other wonderfull thyng to be noted, For as it appereth in the goſpell, the child in ſaynt Elizabethes wombe, that is to ſay, ſaynt Iohn Baptiſt (whiche yet had ſcant lyfe) gaue te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to this <hi>Fruite,</hi> that this fruite ſhulde ſaue hym and all the worlde, and as a prophete he lepte for ioy in his mothers wombe, &amp; although he could not than ſpeake, yet neuertheles he declared by ſuch ſignes and tokens as he could, that bleſſed was the fruite of that wombe, And worthily called the fruit of her wombe in that the ſubſtance of the nature of man, whiche our ſauiour Chriſte toke vppon him, was taken of the ſubſtance and nature of the moſte bleſſed virgin, and in her wombe. And ſo is called the fruite of her wombe. And well he may be called the bleſſed fruite, whiche hath ſaued vs and gyuen vs lyfe, contrary to the curſyd fruite, whych Eue gaue to Adam, by whyche we were deſtroyed and brought to deathe: But bleſſed is the fruite of this wombe, whyche is the fruite of life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that although this ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion be not a prayer of petition, ſupplication, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt or ſuit: Yet neuertheles, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church hath vſed to adioyn it to the end of the <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> as an himne, or a praier of laude and praiſe, partly of our lorde &amp; ſauiour Ieſu Chriſte, for our redemtion, and partly of the bleſſed virgin, for her humble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent gyuen &amp; expreſſed to the angell, at this ſalutation.

               <p>Other workes there be, whiche be not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as theſe, &amp; yet they be done by the grace of god in faith and good affection of harte towardes god, as thoſe be, which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue ben in deadly ſinne and by grace turne to god, do worke &amp; bring forthe vpon reſpecte and remorſe, that they haue for theyr offences done againſt god. And theſe may be called proprely the workes of penance. As for exaumple: whan a ſinner hearing or remembring the lawe of god, is moued by grace, to be contrite and ſorye for his offences, and beginneth to lament his eſtate, &amp; to fall to prayer and other good dedes, ſeking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, and to be reconciled in to his fauour: Theſe workes come of grace, but yet this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not to be accompted a iuſtified man, but he is yet in ſekinge remiſſion of his ſinnes, and his iuſtification, which the anguiſhe of his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence telleth him, that he yet wanteth, but he is in a good way, and by theſe meanes doth entre into iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and if he do procede &amp; with harty deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeke for further grace, he ſhall be aſſured of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſinnes, and atteine his iuſtification, and ſo be made able and mete to walke in the very pure ſeruice of god, with a cleane conſcience, and to bringe forth the foreſaide workes of rightuouſnes in Chriſt, which he can not do, afore he be iuſtified.</p>
               <p>And that ſuche workes of penance, as we haue ſpoken of, be required to the atteining of remiſſion of ſynnes and iuſtification: It is very euident and playne by ſcripture, as when our ſauiour Chriſte

               <p>And here is ſpecially to be noted, that it is not in the power or knowlege of any man, to limit and diſpence, how moch, and in what ſpace of time, or to what perſon particularly the ſaid maſſes, exequies, and ſuffrages do profite and auayle: Therfore cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie requireth, that who ſo euer cauſeth any ſuche maſſes, exequies, or ſuffrages to be done, ſhuld yet
<pb facs="tcp:11197:116"/>
(though their intente be more for one then for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) cauſe them alſo to be done for the vniuerſal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gregation of chriſten people quycke and deade, for that power and knowlege afore reherſed perteineth only vnto god, which alone knoweth the meaſures and times of his owne iudgement and mercies.</p>
               <p>Furthermore bicauſe the place where the ſow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>les remaine, the name therof, the ſtate &amp; condition which they be in, be to vs vncertaine, therfore theſe with al other ſuche thinges, muſt alſo be left to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty god, vnto whoſe mercy it is meete and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient for vs, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende them, truſtyng that god accepteth our prayers for them reſeruyng the reſte holy to god, vnto whome is knowen theyr eſtate &amp; condition, And not we to take vppon vs neyther in the one part, ne yet in the other, to gyue any fonde and temerarious iudgement, in ſo hyghe thynges, ſo farre paſſing our knowlege.</p>
               <p>Finally it is moch neceſſary, that all ſuch abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as heretofore haue bene brought in, by ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and mainteners of the papacye of Rome, and their complicies, concerning this matter, be clerely put awaye, and that we therfore abſteine from the name of purgatory, and no more diſpute or reaſon therof. Vnder colour of whiche, haue ben aduanſed many fonde and great abuſes, to make men beleue that through the biſhop of Romes pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, ſoules mighte clerely be deliuered out of it, &amp; releaſed out of the bondage of ſynne. And that maſſes ſayde at <hi>Scala celi,</hi> and other preſcribed places pha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſied by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did there in thoſe places more profit the ſoules,
<pb facs="tcp:11197:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them in an other. And alſo that a preſcribed numbre of prayers, ſoner than other (thoughe as deuoutly ſaid) ſhuld further their petition ſoner: yea ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they were ſaide before one image more than an other, which they phantaſied. Al theſe and ſuch like abuſes be neceſſary vtterly to be aboliſhed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
